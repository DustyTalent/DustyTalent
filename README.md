- 👋 Hi, I’m @DustyTalent
- 👀 I’m interested in coding random shit, making old fashined video games, hac- I mean totally legal pentesting and stuff, and world domination, I have an intense desire to raise my own army, make everyone in the world bow to me as their ruler.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, mostly learning more intermediate python stuff then I will learn C# (already know C# basics) then C++ maybe java

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing but I will let you mess around on random python projects I make, hopefully you make something cool

- 📫 How to reach me, idk
